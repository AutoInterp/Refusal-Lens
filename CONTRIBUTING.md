# Setting up a development environment manually

You can set up a development environment by running:

```zsh
python3 -m venv venv          # create a virtualenv called venv
source ./venv/bin/activate   # now `python` points to the virtualenv python
pip install -v -e ".[dev]"    # -v for verbose, -e for editable, [dev] for dev dependencies
```

# Testing

Use pytest to run the unit checks:

```bash
pytest
```

# Coverage

Use pytest-cov to generate coverage reports:

```bash
pytest --cov=ٍrefusal_lens
```
